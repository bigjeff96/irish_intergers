- [X] add micro_ui to make buttons baby

- [X] show already flipped numbers
- [X] flip a number
- [X] be able to:
  - [X] take an already flipped number
  - [X] refactor code for flipped board and normal board
  - [X] take a specific flipped number by selecting it via the mouse
  - [X] put piece in hand in the flipped section
  - [X] choose to flip a number
  - [X] swap a placed number with one in hand or already flipped
- [ ] check if new piece on board is valid
- [ ] start game with 4 pieces on the board
- [X] correct swapping pieces bug
- [ ] strong consideration to remove Maybe from the codebase
- [X] instead of storing pointer to pieces on board, put board and cell position in piece struct (give it a try)
- [X] remove cell_state, since it only holds highlight bool, but there only can be 1 cell highlighted at a time, better to just put that logic in the game struct
- [ ] stop game when in win state
- [X] make bigger ui buttons (more like big square)
- [ ] allow key binding to activate button
